# Interactive Chatbot

This Python program is an interactive chatbot that engages with the user through a series of questions and interactions. The chatbot has several functions, including greeting the user, guessing their age, counting numbers, and testing their literature knowledge.

## Features

- Greets the user with the provided bot name and birth year.
- Reminds the user to input their name and responds with a personalized message.
- Guesses the user's age based on remainders of dividing by 3, 5, and 7.
- Counts from 0 to a user-specified number.
- Conducts a literature knowledge test about the book "One Hundred Years of Solitude."

## Instructions

1. Run the Python program in an environment that supports Python.
2. The chatbot will greet the user with the provided bot name and birth year.
3. The chatbot will then ask for the user's name and respond with a personalized message.
4. The chatbot will guess the user's age based on remainders of dividing by 3, 5, and 7.
5. The chatbot will count from 0 to a number specified by the user.
6. The chatbot will conduct a literature knowledge test about the book "One Hundred Years of Solitude."

## Notes

- Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- The program uses basic arithmetic operations to guess the user's age and count numbers.
- The literature knowledge test is a multiple-choice question with the correct answer being option 2.
- You can modify the questions, responses, and logic of the program to create different interactions.
